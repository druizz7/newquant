		<div>
		Pursuant to Section 1115A of the Social Security Act, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), 
		Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation (Innovation Center), is authorized to test alternative models 
		for payment so as to incentivize care episode redesign, engage and protect beneficiaries, and learn and diffuse 
		best practices in order to inform potential changes to the Medicare fee-for-service (FFS) program. 
		<br><br>

		Through the Innovation Center's Bundled Payments for Care Improvement Initiative, this project is to test 
		the use of bundled payment for an episode of care as an alternative approach to fee-for-service payment of health care. 
		The Bundled Payments for Care Improvement-Continuity Assessment Record and Evaluation (B-CARE) Tool will be utilized to assess:

		<br/>
		<br/>
		<!--
		<b>Model 1: </b><br>Retrospective bundled payment models around the acute inpatient hospital stay.<br><br>
		-->
		<b>Model 2: </b><br>Retrospective bundled payment models for hospitals, physicians, and post-acute providers for an episode of care consisting of an inpatient hospital staff followed by post-acute care.<br><br>
		<b>Model 3: </b><br>Retrospective bundled payment models for post-acute care where the bundle does not include the acute inpatient hospital stay.<br><br>
		<b>Model 4: </b><br>Prospectively administered bundled payment models for acute inpatient hospital stay and related readmissions only.<br><br>
